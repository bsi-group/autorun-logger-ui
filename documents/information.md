# AutoRun Logger (User Interface)

The User Interface (UI) is split into four sections; Alerts, Single Host, Search and Data. The

## Alerts
Alerts are generated by the analysis server. Alerts indicate that either a new autorun item has been added, an autorun has been modified (launch string, file path, SHA256) or an autorun has been deleted.

## Single Host
The Single Host view shows the current AutoRun data for a single host. Individual AutoRun data can be downloaded as a CSV delimited file.

## Search
The Search view permits simple searching of the Alert/Autorun data. The **Data** dropdown allows either the Alerts or Autorun data to be searched. The **Type** dropdown is used to search specific fields of the data type.

## Export
The Export view allows the downloading of single sets of data. The exports available are:
- SHA256: All SHA256 hashes from the current autoruns data
- MD5: All MD5 hashes from the current autoruns data
- Domains: All domains from the current autoruns data
- Hosts: All hosts from the current autoruns data
- User: All users from the current autoruns data
- Host: All autoruns from a single host
